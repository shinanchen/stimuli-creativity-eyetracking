#Description,"Number of respondents that were presented with the stimulus or relevant interval.","Average age of the respondents.","Type of the interval that the metrics refers to.","Group of the interval.","Name of the interval.","Average duration of the interval.","Name of the parent.","Average duration of the parent.","Average percentage of the parent's duration during which the AOI was active.","Average percentage of collected and interpolated samples during the interval. Values below 100% indicate missing data.","Size of the AOI in square pixels.","Size of the AOI in square centimeters.","Percentage of the stimulus' area covered by the AOI.","Number of respondents that gazed at the AOI.","Percentage of respondents that gazed at the AOI.","Average of how often the gaze of the respondents entered the AOI (i.e. how often they visited the AOI on average).","Average of how often the respondents looked back at the AOI after the first dwell.","Index of the order in which the AOIs were on average gazed at for the first time for the current parent.","Average time that passed until a gaze entered the AOI for the first time (relative to AOI onset).","Average time that passed until a gaze entered the AOI for the first time (relative to parent interval onset).","Average of how long the respondents gazed at the AOI.","Average of how long the respondents gazed at the AOI in relation to the time during which the AOI was active.","Average duration of the respondents' very first dwell on the AOI.","Average duration of the respondents' very last dwell on the AOI.","Average of how often the respondent gazed at the AOI without any detected fixation.","Number of respondents that fixated on the AOI.","Percentage of respondents that fixated on the AOI.","Average of how often the respondents looked at the AOI and fixated on it at least once.","Average of how often the respondents looked back and fixated at the AOI after the first dwell.","Average amount of fixations detected inside the AOI.","Index of the order in which the AOIs were on average fixated at for the first time for the current parent.","Average time that passed until the first fixation was detected inside the AOI (relative to AOI onset).","Average time that passed until the first fixation was detected inside the AOI (relative to parent interval onset).","Average time that passed until the first fixation was detected inside the AOI (relative to parent interval onset). In case respondents did not fixate on the AOI, their parent's presentation duration (as maximally possible time) is used for the average.","Average of how long the respondents fixated at the AOI.","Average of how long the respondents fixated at the AOI in relation to the time during which the AOI was active.","Average duration of all fixations detected inside the AOI.","Average duration of the respondents' very first fixation inside the AOI.","Average duration of the respondents' very last fixation inside the AOI.","Average of how wide the gaze points of the respondents' fixations were spread out.","Number of respondents that had a saccade within the AOI.","Percentage of respondents that had a saccade within the AOI.","Average of how often the respondents looked at the AOI with at least one whole saccade detected between entry and exit.","Average amount of saccades detected inside the AOI.","Average time that passed until the first saccade was directed towards the AOI (relative to AOI onset).","Average time that passed until the first saccade was directed towards the AOI (relative to parent interval onset).","Average duration of all saccades detected inside the AOI.","Average amplitude of all saccades detected inside the AOI (i.e. angular distance that the eyes travelled from start point to end point).","Average peak velocity of all saccades detected inside the AOI (i.e. the maximal speed of the eyes during this saccade).","Average peak acceleration of all saccades detected inside the AOI (i.e. the maximal increase in speed of the eyes during this saccade).","Average peak deceleration of all saccades detected inside the AOI (i.e. the maximal decrease in speed of the eyes during this saccade).","Average direction of all saccades detected inside the AOI, indicated as clockwise angles: 0 degrees mean a horizontal saccade from left to right, 90 degrees a vertical saccade from top to bottom.","Number of respondents that clicked inside the AOI.","Percentage of respondents that clicked inside the AOI.","Average amount of mouse clicks detected inside the AOI."
